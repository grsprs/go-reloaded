# Project Brief – Go Reloaded

## Overview
Modular text processing system in Go that applies intelligent transformations to improve text readability and consistency.

## Core Features
- **Numeric Conversions**: `1E (hex)` → `30`, `10 (bin)` → `2`
- **Case Operations**: `(up)`, `(low)`, `(cap)` with batch support `(up, n)`
- **Formatting**: Smart punctuation spacing and quote normalization
- **Grammar**: Article correction `a apple` → `an apple`

## Architecture
```
Input File → Tokenizer → [Transformations] → Reconstructor → Output File
```

**Benefits:**
- Modular testing and development
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy maintenance and debugging

## Development Approach
- **TDD**: Test-first development with golden test validation
- **Agile**: Iterative development with continuous integration
- **AI-Assisted**: Prompt-based task decomposition and analysis

## Success Metrics
- 100% golden test compliance
- ≥90% unit test coverage
- Performance: <1s for 1MB files
- Zero critical defects
