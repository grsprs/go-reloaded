# Project Brief – Go Reloaded

## Project Overview
**Go Reloaded** is a modular text processing system built in Go that performs intelligent linguistic and formatting transformations on input files.  
It applies structured transformation rules to improve readability, consistency, and professional quality of text documents.

## Core Functionality
- Read and parse input text files  
- Detect and interpret embedded transformation markers  
- Apply numeric conversions, text case operations, punctuation corrections, and grammatical adjustments  
- Generate clean, standardized, and professional output text  
- Ensure full integrity of original content through every processing stage  

## Technical Architecture

### Processing Model: Pipeline Framework
**Stages:**
1. **File Input Handler** – load and validate input data  
2. **Text Tokenization Engine** – split text into processable units  
3. **Transformation Pipeline** – sequentially apply rule-based transformations  
4. **Text Reconstruction System** – rebuild text into final form  
5. **Output Handler** – save processed results to file  

**Pipeline Advantages:**
- Modular and independently testable architecture  
- Simplified debugging and maintenance  
- Transparent data flow across all components  
- Scalable for future rule additions  
- Enables parallel development and CI/CD integration  

## Transformation Rules

### Numeric Conversions
- **Hexadecimal** → decimal: `1E (hex)` → `30`  
- **Binary** → decimal: `10 (bin)` → `2`  
- Preserves invalid cases without corruption

### Text Case Operations
- **Single-word transformations:** `(up)`, `(low)`, `(cap)`  
- **Batch operations:** `(modifier, n)` applied to multiple consecutive words  

### Formatting Intelligence
- Smart punctuation spacing and grouping  
- Quote spacing normalization  
- Contextual article correction (`a` → `an` before vowel sounds)  

## Development Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Define transformation behavior before implementation  
- Validate each module independently  
- Use **Golden Test Set** for end-to-end verification  
- Maintain automated testing via CI pipeline  

### Agile Delivery Approach
- Iterative, incremental development cycles  
- Frequent reviews and sprint-level retrospectives  
- Cross-functional collaboration between development, QA, and DevOps  
- Continuous documentation and knowledge sharing  

## Success Criteria
- 100% rule accuracy across all test cases  
- Complete Golden Test Set compliance  
- Maintainable and well-documented codebase  
- High performance with large text inputs  
- Automated validation and deployment  

## Strategic Value
- Strengthens Go expertise through practical application  
- Demonstrates advanced text processing and rule-based logic  
- Promotes enterprise-grade software design principles  
- Enhances collaboration under agile development methodology
