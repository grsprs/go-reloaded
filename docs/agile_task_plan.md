# Agile Task Plan – Go Reloaded

## Objective
To structure the Go Reloaded development into clear, incremental Agile tasks that follow a **test-first (TDD)** methodology, supported by AI-assisted task generation and learning feedback.

## Task List

| # | Role | Description | Test-First Goal | Implementation Target | Validation |
|---|------|--------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Junior Dev | Create unit tests for file I/O | Ensure file read/write consistency | Implement I/O handler | Compare file hashes |
| 2 | AI Assistant | Generate tokenization tests | Test token splitting logic | Implement Tokenizer | Validate against expected token arrays |
| 3 | Dev | Write conversion tests for `(hex)` and `(bin)` | Verify numeric parsing and decimal conversion | Implement NumberTransformer | Match outputs in Golden Set |
| 4 | Dev | Define casing transformation tests `(up)`, `(low)`, `(cap)` | Test string case conversion | Implement CaseTransformer | Validate multi-word transformations |
| 5 | Dev | Add tests for `(up, n)` and `(low, n)` | Ensure sequential multi-token conversion | Extend CaseTransformer logic | Check against complex test cases |
| 6 | Dev | Write punctuation normalization tests | Ensure spacing and symbol rules are correct | Implement PunctuationHandler | Validate spacing via diff tests |
| 7 | Dev | Add quote formatting tests | Verify proper placement of `'` | Implement QuoteFormatter | Check edge cases of nested quotes |

| 9 | QA | Integrate all modules in pipeline test | Verify combined transformations | Build main pipeline controller | Validate full text transformations |
|10 | DevOps | Automate test suite execution | Ensure full pipeline coverage | Implement CI script | All tests green in pipeline |
|11 | Dev | Add performance benchmark tests | Verify FSM prototype speed | Implement FSM simulation | Compare performance metrics |
|12 | QA | Regression test validation | Check for consistency across versions | Run Golden Test Set | Outputs identical |
|13 | Tech Writer | Document transformation logic | Generate developer guide | Write `README` and architecture docs | Validate completeness via peer review |
|14 | Architect | Meta prompting calibration | Define AI task refinement rules | Adjust system prompts for precision | Validate AI task accuracy |
|15 | Team Lead | Sprint retrospective | Identify improvement areas | Document iteration insights | Final approval checklist |

## Prompt Introspection Section

### Assumptions
- Developers understand Go basics.
- AI agents assist in test and task drafting.
- Golden Test Set represents the single source of truth.

### Change Scenarios
If new transformation types are introduced (e.g., `(rev)` for reversing words), the architecture adapts by:
- Adding a new module to the pipeline.
- Writing test-first cases before implementation.
- Updating documentation automatically through AI-assisted prompts.

## Validation Summary
Project completion is achieved when all Golden Test Set cases pass, and each pipeline module validates independently under both unit and integration testing. Continuous documentation ensures enterprise readiness.
