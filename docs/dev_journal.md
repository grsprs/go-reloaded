# Developer Journal – Go Reloaded

## Overview
This developer journal documents reasoning, challenges and reflections throughout the design phase for the Go Reloaded project. It records key phases, decisions and short reflective notes.

## Phase 1 – Problem Understanding
- Reviewed specification and identified rule categories: numeric conversion, casing, punctuation, quotes, grammar.
- Chose Pipeline architecture for modularity and testability.

## Phase 2 – Meta-Prompting Framework
- Designed meta-prompt templates for AI-assisted task decomposition.
- Each prompt generates task descriptions with TDD-first goals and references to golden tests.

## Phase 3 – Agile Task Planning
- Created a stepwise task plan to implement and validate each transformation stage.
- Included prompt introspection notes describing assumptions and potential changes.

## Phase 4 – Repository & Conventions
- Adopted Go community layout: cmd/, internal/, pkg/, docs/, tests/.
- Added this dev_journal.md to capture progress and reflections.

## Challenge-Solution Tracking

### Challenge: Initial Resistance
**Problem:** Hesitation to start complex project  
**Solution:** Breaking into phases + journaling  
**Result:** Clear path forward, reduced anxiety

### Challenge: Architecture Decision
**Problem:** Choosing between Pipeline vs FSM approaches  
**Solution:** Evaluated team needs vs performance trade-offs  
**Result:** Selected Pipeline for better collaboration and testing

## Key Learning Moments

### Architecture Trade-offs
**Insight:** Pipeline vs FSM isn't about "better" but "more appropriate"  
**Application:** Chose pipeline for team collaboration over raw performance

### Team Dynamics
**Insight:** Transparency about challenges builds team confidence  
**Application:** Shared initial hesitations, discovered common experiences

## Peer Discussion Insights
**Shared Experience:** Others also felt initial overwhelm with project scope  
**Positive Outcome:** Collective confidence boost through transparent communication  
**Team Benefit:** Created supportive environment for asking questions

## Reflection
Journaling improved clarity, reduced hesitation to start, and supported peer discussions during design review. The process of documenting challenges and solutions transformed initial resistance into structured problem-solving approach.

## Future Journaling Plan
- Continue documenting major technical decisions and rationale
- Track team collaboration patterns and improvements  
- Record lessons learned for future project reference
- Use journal as knowledge base for new team members
