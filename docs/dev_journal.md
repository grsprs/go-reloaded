# Developer Journal – Go Reloaded

## Overview
This developer journal documents reasoning, challenges and reflections throughout the design phase for the Go Reloaded project. It records key phases, decisions and short reflective notes.

## Phase 1 – Problem Understanding
- Reviewed specification and identified rule categories: numeric conversion, casing, punctuation, quotes, grammar.
- Chose Pipeline architecture for modularity and testability.

## Phase 2 – Meta-Prompting Framework
- Designed meta-prompt templates for AI-assisted task decomposition.
- Each prompt generates task descriptions with TDD-first goals and references to golden tests.

## Phase 3 – Agile Task Planning
- Created a stepwise task plan to implement and validate each transformation stage.
- Included prompt introspection notes describing assumptions and potential changes.

## Phase 4 – Repository & Conventions
- Adopted Go community layout: cmd/, internal/, pkg/, docs/, tests/.
- Added this dev_journal.md to capture progress and reflections.

## Reflection
Journaling improved clarity, reduced hesitation to start, and supported peer discussions during design review.
