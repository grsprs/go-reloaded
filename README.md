# Go Reloaded

### A Go-based Text Transformation Project

**Go Reloaded** is a project focused on text analysis, transformation, and formatting automation.  
The objective is to design a simple but structured command-line tool that can process a text file, apply specific transformation rules, and produce a corrected output file.

---

## üéØ Objective
The project aims to explore the logic of text manipulation in Go.  
Participants analyze a set of language rules, design a clear architecture, and define functional test cases.  
The emphasis is on *analysis, design, and clarity of logic*, not on rapid coding.

---

## üí° Learning Goals
- Understanding how textual data can be processed programmatically.  
- Applying structured architectural thinking (Pipeline or FSM models).  
- Practicing documentation and peer collaboration through audits.  
- Designing a clean, modular, and testable approach in Go.

---

## üß± Core Description
The tool will read an **input file**, apply a series of text transformations, and write the **output** to another file.  
Transformations include:
- Hexadecimal and binary number conversion  
- Text case modification (upper, lower, capitalize)  
- Grammar-based article correction (`a` ‚Üí `an`)  
- Punctuation and quotation cleanup

Each rule contributes to producing a clean and grammatically consistent text.

## üß≠ Process Overview
1. **Analysis Phase** ‚Äì define and document the problem clearly.  
2. **Architecture Choice** ‚Äì compare Pipeline and FSM models, justify your selection.  
3. **Golden Test Definition** ‚Äì create a set of natural language test cases that describe correct behavior.  
4. **Audit Phase** ‚Äì exchange feedback with peers to ensure mutual understanding.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Usage (after implementation)
```bash
$ go run . input.txt output.txt
```

The program should process the text according to the defined transformation rules and output the corrected version.

---

## ‚ú® Purpose
The project combines structured thinking, collaboration, and technical documentation.  
It helps participants strengthen their understanding of text processing, while improving clarity, precision, and communication ‚Äî core skills in any software development context.
